Welcome to **CHAT GPT 42**, a project developed not only to satisfy curiosity but also for those who seek a more accessible alternative to Chat GPT Plus. 😱

After all, Chat GPT Plus costs 20$ Bidens 🤡 🤡 🤡, we were born beautiful, not rich, and our goal is to save while learning!



## Motivation

This project arose from the desire to integrate directly with OpenAI, bypassing the barrier of Chat GPT Plus, and creating our own version, economically more viable 💸 💸 💸 🚀

Here, in addition to the search for savings, the project also serves as a testing ground for the beta 13.3 version of NextJS, exploring its possibilities and features that challenge the laws of space and time. ⏱️

## Technologies used

- [NextJS 13.3.0](https://beta.nextjs.org/) 🆕 
- [Tailwind CSS 🌈](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [OpenAI API 🧠](https://openai.com/)
- [Socket.IO ⚡️](https://socket.io/)(coming soon, for real-time implementation)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pt/) (we even save on disk space 🥲)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pnpm i`.
3. Configure environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) in `.env.local` (an OpenAI API key is required).
4. Run the project with `pnpm dev`.
5. Access `http://localhost:3000` and start interacting with CHAT GPT 42!

## Inspiration

CHAT GPT 42 is inspired by ["The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), and if you know the work, you already know that "42" is the answer to life, the universe, and everything else. So, here you will find not just a GPT chat, but an intergalactic experience! 🎉

Enjoy the journey, and don't forget: Bring your towel and Don't panic! 🚀
